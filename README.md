# Splitrail

Splitrail is a **fast, cross-platform, real-time token usage tracker and cost monitor for**:
- [Gemini CLI](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli) (and [Qwen Code](https://github.com/qwenlm/qwen-code))
- [Claude Code](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code)
- [Codex CLI](https://github.com/openai/codex)
- [Cline](https://github.com/cline/cline) / [Roo Code](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code) / [Zoo Code](https://github.com/Zoo-Code-Org/Zoo-Code/) / [Kilo Code](https://github.com/Kilo-Org/kilocode) (VS Code extension + CLI)
- [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) (VS Code)
- [GitHub Copilot CLI](https://github.com/features/copilot)
- [OpenCode](https://github.com/sst/opencode)
- [Pi Agent](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/tree/main/packages/coding-agent)
- Grok
- [DeepSeek Harness](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness)

Run one command to instantly review all of your CLI coding agent usage.  Upload your usage data to your private account on the [Splitrail Cloud](https://splitrail.dev) for safe-keeping and cross-machine usage aggregation.

## Local Web Dashboard

Run `splitrail web` and open `http://127.0.0.1:8765` to view usage trends by hour, day, week, month, or year. The dashboard filters by model, project, tool, metric (total, input, output, cached, reasoning tokens, or cost), and time range. Weeks start on Monday. Use `splitrail web --port 9000` to choose another local port. Refresh in the page to reload local usage files. The server only listens on the local loopback address; no usage data is uploaded.

Type in the model, project, or tool field to narrow its choices, then select any number of values. Selections within one field are combined; selections across fields narrow the results together. Remove a selection using its chip, or choose Clear all in that field.

The model, project, and tool lists show only values with nonzero usage for the selected metric and time range. Empty time periods remain on the chart so gaps in usage are visible.

The trend chart draws a total line plus one line for each nonzero combination of the selected projects, models, and tools. Unselected dimensions are combined. Click a line or legend item to focus it, then click again to restore all lines. The breakdown table shows each combination's value for every time period.

Token total uses the same definition as the TUI: input + output + cached tokens. Reasoning tokens are shown separately.

The page supports Chinese and English. It starts in your browser's language when supported, and the language selector remembers your choice in this browser.

## MCP Server

Splitrail can run as an [MCP (Model Context Protocol)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) server, allowing AI assistants to query your usage statistics programmatically.

```bash
splitrail mcp
```

### Available Tools

- `get_daily_stats` - Query usage statistics with date filtering
- `get_model_usage` - Analyze model usage distribution
- `get_cost_breakdown` - Get cost breakdown over a date range
- `get_file_operations` - Get file operation statistics
- `compare_tools` - Compare usage across different AI coding tools
- `list_analyzers` - List available analyzers

### Resources

- `splitrail://summary` - Daily summaries across all dates
- `splitrail://models` - Model usage breakdown

## Configuration

Splitrail stores its configuration at `~/.splitrail.toml`:

```toml
[server]
url = "https://splitrail.dev"
api_token = "your-api-token"

[upload]
auto_upload = false
upload_today_only = false

[formatting]
number_comma = false
number_human = false
locale = "en"
decimal_places = 2

[logging]
level = "warn"
```

## Development

### Windows

On Windows, we use `lld-link.exe` from LLVM to significantly speed up compilation, so you'll need to install it to compile Splitrail.  Example for `winget`:

```shell
winget install --id LLVM.LLVM
```

Then add it to your system PATH:
```cmd
:: Command prompt
setx /M PATH "%PATH%;C:\Program Files\LLVM\bin\"
set "PATH=%PATH%;C:\Program Files\LLVM\bin"
```
or
```pwsh
# PowerShell
setx /M PATH "$env:PATH;C:\Program Files\LLVM\bin\"
$env:PATH = "$env:PATH;C:\Program Files\LLVM\bin\"
```

Then use standard Cargo commands to build and run:

```shell
cargo run
```

### macOS/Linux

Build as normal:
```
cargo run
```
