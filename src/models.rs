    // Every xAI tier boundary below is written as `Some(199_999)`, not
    // `Some(200_000)`. xAI labels each long-context tier "≥ 200k tokens" and
    // says the long rates apply once a prompt *reaches* the threshold, so a
    // prompt of exactly 200,000 tokens must bill long. `find_tier` treats a
    // limit as inclusive (`tokens <= limit` selects that tier), so the short
    // tier has to stop one token earlier. Other vendors in this file publish
    // "> 200K" boundaries and correctly keep `Some(200_000)`; do not unify the
    // two spellings without re-reading each vendor's wording.
